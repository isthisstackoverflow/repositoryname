# repositoryname

_The repository that contains what repositories should contain._

On the one hand, we have packages. See packages folder.

On the other, we have [this](https://isthisstackoverflow.github.io/repositoryname/index.html). It's a webpage consisting of german texts and, probably soonish, international images.
