# repositoryname

_The repository that contains what repositories should contain._

On the one hand, we have packages. See packages folder; each package comes with its respective documentation.

On the other, we have [nothing](https://isthisstackoverflow.github.io/repositoryname/index.html), presented as a viewable webpage that appears to include contents. I am not particularly happy with it.
