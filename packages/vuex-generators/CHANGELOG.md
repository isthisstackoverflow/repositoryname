# CHANGELOG

## 1.1.2

- Works now on getters instead of state, making it harmonic to other generators. Previous behaviour somewhat feels like a bug, hence modelling this as patch.

## 1.1.1

- Fixed variable name.

## 1.1.0

- Added usage example to **[README](README.md)**.
- Added directory to package.json repository link.
- Added getSetGenerator. See **[README](README.md)**.

## 1.0.1

- Added **[README](README.md)** to package.
- Added GitHub repository to npm published package.

## 1.0.0

- Initial publish. It's feature-complete.
